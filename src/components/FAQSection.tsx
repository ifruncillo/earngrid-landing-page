      question: "How much can I actually earn?",
      answer: "Earnings depend on your computer specs and idle time. Most users earn $15-50/month running overnight and during work hours. High-end computers with 16GB+ RAM can earn $50-100/month."
    },
    {
      question: "Is it safe for my computer?",
      answer: "Yes. EarnGrid uses the same system-level safety protocols as antivirus software. Your personal files remain completely private and untouched. The software only uses spare processing power."
    },
    {
      question: "Will it slow down my computer?",
      answer: "No. EarnGrid automatically pauses the moment you use your computer. It only runs during true idle time when you're not actively using your device."
    },
    {
      question: "How do I get paid?",
      answer: "Payments are processed weekly via direct deposit, PayPal, or cryptocurrency. You'll receive detailed earnings reports and can withdraw anytime with a minimum balance of $10."
    },
    {
      question: "What kind of work does my computer do?",
      answer: "Your computer contributes to distributed computing tasks like data processing, machine learning training, and scientific research. All work is completely legal and beneficial."
    },
    {
      question: "Can I uninstall it anytime?",
      answer: "Absolutely. EarnGrid uninstalls completely like any other software. No residual files or changes remain on your system."
